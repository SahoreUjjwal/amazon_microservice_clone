Amazon Clone Backend
This repository contains the backend services for an Amazon clone application. The backend is built using Node.js and follows a microservices architecture. Here’s an overview of the different microservices and their responsibilities:

Customer Service:
Handles all user-related events.
Manages user authentication, registration, and profile information.
Communicates with the front end to provide user-specific data.
Product Service:
Responsible for product-related events.
Manages product catalog, inventory, and details.
Supports product search, filtering, and recommendations.
Shopping Microservice:
Handles order-related events.
Manages shopping cart, checkout process, and order history.
Integrates with payment gateways for secure transactions.
Event-Driven Architecture
The communication between microservices is based on an event-driven architecture. We use RabbitMQ as the message broker to facilitate asynchronous communication. Events are published and consumed by the relevant services, ensuring loose coupling and scalability.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend services are written in Node.js for their flexibility and performance.
Express.js: A lightweight web application framework for building APIs.
MongoDB: Used for data storage (user profiles, product details, orders).
RabbitMQ: The message broker for event communication.
Docker: Each microservice is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
Nginx: Configured as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and distribute them to the appropriate microservices.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone-backend.git

Install Dependencies:
